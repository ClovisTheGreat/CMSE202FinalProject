The intersection interaction project aims to use agent-based modeling in Python to simulate simple traffic intersections on a micro scale. Our project compares the efficiency of a stopsign and stoplight on a 4-way intersection between 2-lane roads. Our model uses a parent intersection class, two subclasses (Stopsign and Stoplight), and a vehicle class to create vehicle objects for the intersections to hold. Among replicating driving behavior as well as we can, our investigation is driven by then tracking the time it takes for each car to get through the intersection and reach its destination. By simulating varying traffic flows, we can analyze how each intersection type handles each traffic flow. 

Visualizations of each intersection can be found below the declaration of each subclass, and more expansive data collection can be found near the end of the notebook. It NOT recommended to run all cells upon opening the main notebook. Many cells contain computationally intensive simulations. It is instead recommended to first progress through the project linearly and interupt the kernal whenever necessary.
